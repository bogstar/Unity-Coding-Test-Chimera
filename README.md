#Chimera Test - Tactics Unity Game#

This game prototype was made on 11th August 2019 for the purpose of testing coding and Unity knowledge. 

Link to itchio game site is [here](https://bogstar.itch.io/chimera-unity-code-test).

##How to play:##

Kill all enemies before they kill you.

When you start your turn, you get control of a unit, and the phase will change to Action. Attack the enemy units, reducing their HP. When a unit reaches 0 HP, they die.

###-Action Phase###
You can see your selected unit's (green highlight) movement range (yellow highlight), and if you hold Shift, you will see its attack range (magenta highlight) after your unit arrives at destination. You can also issue an attack at an enemy unit (red highlight).

You can also right click to deselect unit and switch to Selection phase.

###-Selection Phase###
You can hover over a unit to see its movement range (cyan highlight) and hold shift over it to see its attack range (magenta highlight).

To return back to Action phase, simply left click on the unit that is on its turn.
